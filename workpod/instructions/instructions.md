# Instructions for Building the UI

This document outlines the guidelines and expectations for designing and implementing the UI for the WorkPod app. The goal is to align the UI with the existing styles of the register and login forms while allowing creative freedom to ensure the app adheres to modern UI design standards and best practices.

---

## **1. Design Goals**
- Ensure a cohesive and consistent visual identity across the app by using the same style as the existing register and login forms.
- Allow the designer/developer to use their expertise and creativity to craft pages that follow modern UI guidelines.
- Prioritize a clean, intuitive, and user-friendly design that is responsive on all devices.

---

## **2. Existing Style Guidelines**
### **Reference Register and Login Forms**
- Use the register and login form styles as the foundation for the app's visual identity.
- Key design elements to replicate:
  - Typography (fonts, sizes, weights).
  - Color palette (primary, secondary, and accent colors).
  - Button styles (e.g., rounded corners, hover states).
  - Input field design (e.g., borders, padding, error states).
  - Spacing and layout principles.

### **UI Components to Keep Consistent**
- Buttons: Style should match the register/login forms.
- Forms: Inputs, labels, and validation messages should follow the same style.
- Modal dialogs: Match the register/login modal style if applicable.

---

## **3. Developer/Designer Creative Freedom**
- You have the flexibility to design the remaining pages and components in a way that feels modern and professional, while maintaining consistency with the register/login forms.
- Feel free to introduce:
  - Advanced layouts (e.g., cards, grids, and sidebars).
  - Animations or transitions for smoother interactions.
  - Light and dark themes if it fits the design.

---

## **4. Pages to Build**
### **1. Home/Map View**
- Display WorkPod locations on a map.
- Include:
  - Floating card for selected WorkPod details.
  - Actions: "Reserve", "Join Waitlist" (if unavailable).
- **Creative Input:**
  - Decide how the map and floating card integrate visually.
  - Suggest how users switch between WorkPods (e.g., swipeable cards, clickable map pins).

### **2. Reservation and Session Management**
- **Reservation Screen:**
  - Show WorkPod details and a countdown timer (10 minutes).
  - Actions: "Cancel", "Start Rent".
- **In-Session Screen:**
  - Display session details, timer, and add-ons.
  - Actions: "Pause", "End".
- **Creative Input:**
  - Propose how to visually display session data and controls.
  - Suggest how to make add-ons intuitive (e.g., toggle switches, cards).

### **3. Feedback and Checkout**
- Feedback form for user reviews.
- Prompts for returning add-ons (e.g., monitor, headphones).
- **Creative Input:**
  - Design a visually engaging feedback system.
  - Make confirmation screens for returned add-ons clear and user-friendly.

### **4. Profile and Settings**
- Editable profile with fields like name, email, and payment methods.
- Include settings for:
  - Rental history.
  - Invite friends (promo codes).
  - Language selection.
- **Creative Input:**
  - Suggest how to organize profile and settings (e.g., tabs, sections).

---

## **5. Technical Implementation**
### **Frameworks and Tools**
- Use Tailwind CSS to ensure consistency and flexibility.
- Responsive design is a must. Ensure it looks great on:
  - Mobile
  - Tablet
  - Desktop

### **UI Development Workflow**
1. Build reusable components (e.g., buttons, modals, input fields).
2. Style components to match the existing register/login forms.
3. Use placeholder data or mock APIs to simulate dynamic behavior.

### **Folder Structure**
Organize the project like this:
src/ components/ ui/ Button.tsx InputField.tsx layouts/ MainLayout.tsx MapLayout.tsx pages/ Home.tsx Reservation.tsx Session.tsx Feedback.tsx Profile.tsx

---

## **6. Guidelines for Creative Freedom**
- Follow modern UI/UX best practices:
  - Use minimalistic and clean layouts.
  - Ensure sufficient spacing and alignment.
  - Use contrast effectively for readability.
  - Apply animations or transitions sparingly for a polished feel.
- Reference design systems for inspiration (e.g., Material Design, Fluent UI).
- Provide design decisions for:
  - Navigation: Decide between a top bar, side drawer, or bottom tab.
  - Page layouts: Offer suggestions for arranging elements visually.
  - State handling: Show how to communicate loading, errors, and success states.

---

## **7. Deliverables**
### **What to Deliver**
- Fully styled UI for all pages listed above.
- Components designed for reuse across the app.
- Screens connected with dummy data for presentation purposes.

### **Timeline**
- Provide an initial draft or wireframe for review within the first week.
- Iterate based on feedback to finalize the UI.

---

## **8. Next Steps After UI**
- Review and polish the UI based on feedback.
- Begin backend integration (e.g., payments, map data).
- Test the UI for responsiveness and usability.

---

By following these guidelines, you can ensure the UI is consistent with the existing forms while giving the designer/developer room to apply their expertise and creativity. Let me know if you need additional clarifications!

## Key Features

### 1. **User Authentication**
- Login, signup, and logout functionality.
- JWT-based authentication with token storage in HTTP-only cookies for security.
- Optional support for OAuth in future iterations.

### 2. **Pod Reservation**

## Dependencies

### **Frontend**
- React (Next.js) for user interface.
- TailwindCSS for styling.
- Stripe SDK for Apple Pay.
- PayPal JavaScript SDK for payment processing.

### **Backend**
- Node.js with Express for APIs.
- PostgreSQL for relational data.
- TTLock API for smart lock integration.
- Socket.io for real-time updates.

---

## Testing Requirements
1. Write unit tests for all key features:
   - Authentication, Reservations, Payments, Add-ons, Smart Locks.
2. Use Jest for backend testing and React Testing Library for frontend components.
3. Mock external APIs (Stripe, PayPal, TTLock) for reliability.

---

## Edge Cases and Assumptions

### **Pod Reservation:**
- If a pod is locked manually without completing checkout, prompt the user to finalize the session.
- Auto-cancel reservations after 10 minutes if no check-in occurs.

### **Payments:**
- If both Apple Pay and PayPal fail, notify the user to retry with another method.

### **Add-Ons:**
- Prevent users from ending a session unless all add-ons are returned and confirmed.
